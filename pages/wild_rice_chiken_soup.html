    <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh sage, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup wild rice, uncooked</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>     

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Coat chicken breasts in salt and pepper, then cover in flour. Reserve excess flour for later.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven that can contain entire soup (about 8 cups). Add chicken to pot and cook for 2 minutes per side or until golden brown. Chicken will not be cooked through. Remove chicken from pot, leaving oil behind.</li>
        <li>Add diced onions and carrots. Sauté for 2 to 4 minutes over medium heat or until vegetables are softened.</li>
        <li>carrots and onions cooked in a pot</li>
        <li>Stir in mushrooms, minced garlic, and flour until combined. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>vegetables sautéed in a pot</li>
        <li>Pour in chicken broth, stirring bottom of pot as you add broth to release any small bits that have stuck. Bring liquid to a boil.</li>
        <li>chicken broth with vegetables in a pot</li>
        <li>Add chicken, sage, thyme, and wild rice. Cover pot, reduce heat to low, and cook for 45 minutes or until rice is tender.</li>
        <li>Remove lid and take out chicken breasts. Chop or shred</li>
        <li>Return chicken back to pot, then stir in heavy cream. Cook for another 5 minutes over medium-low heat until soup is heated through and slightly thickened. (If you like a thicker soup you can whisk together another 1/4 cup of flour with 3 tablespoons of water, then whisk into soup until thickened.)</li>
        <li>Add more salt and pepper to taste and serve topped with chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
