    <h2>Chicken Biscuit Recipe</h2>
    <p> The chicken biscuit may be one of the most craveable snacks. This version is made simple by using store-bought biscuits (although you can make your own if you have the time) and is easily customizable with condiments. If you want it for breakfast, throw on some cheesy scrambled eggs, or add bacon for extra decadence. Try adding chipotle mayo, pickles, or spicy honey instead of regular honey.</p>
